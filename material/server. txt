server: 

    1.server is a software or piece of programm which accept and process the reqeust over the network made by client.
    2.Client is a machine or peice of program which send a data to server over the network.
    3.Clients and servers exchange messages(Data) in a request–response messaging pattern. The client sends a request, and the server returns a response.
    4.By using protocols the client and server can transfer the data. one of the protocol is HTTP.
HTTP:
------
    a.HTTP or HyperText Transfer Protocol is a set of rules that the server needs to follow to transmit all kinds of files like images, text, audio, video, and other kinds over the world wide web (www).
    b. As mention in point 3 the reqeust-response message pattern will made by using http protocols.
    c. HTTP uses `methods` to inform the server what actions need to be performed when the client sends a request. It is also called as HTTP `verbs`. Each of these methods performs the operation required and returns success or failure on its completion. 
    
    HTTP Request Structure from Client:
    -----------------------------------

    => HTTP version type
    => a URL
    => an HTTP method
    => HTTP request headers
    => Optional HTTP body.
        1. An HTTP Methods 
            An HTTP method, a verb (like GET, PUT or POST) or a noun (like HEAD or OPTIONS), that describes the action to be performed. 
            For example, GET indicates that a resource should be fetched or POST means that data is pushed to the server (creating or modifying a resource).
            The request target, usually a URL, or the absolute path of the protocol, port, and domain are usually characterized by the request context.
        2. Headers
            HTTP headers contain text information stored in key-value pairs, and they are included in every HTTP request (and response, more on that later).
            these headers having information such a Content-Type, Autherization tokes, language etc.
        3. Http Body:
            this is Optional for reqest. the body generally contains `info/data` which we need to send over network.
        

     HTTP Response Structure from Web Server:
     ----------------------------------------
        An HTTP response is what web clients (often browsers) receive from an Internet server in answer to an HTTP request. 
        A typical HTTP response contains:

        => an HTTP status code
        => HTTP response headers
        => optional HTTP body

        What’s an HTTP status code?
            HTTP status codes are 3-digit codes most often used to indicate whether an HTTP request has been successfully completed. Status codes are broken into the following 5 blocks:

            1xx Informational
            2xx Success
            3xx Redirection
            4xx Client Error
            5xx Server Error
            The “xx” refers to different numbers between 00 and 99.
        What are HTTP response headers?
            Much like an HTTP request, an HTTP response comes with headers that convey important information such as the language and format of the data being sent in the response body.
            
            ex: 
                Content-Type: application/json
                date: "sun, 07 Feb 2021 18:25:08 GMT
                status: 200
        What’s in an HTTP response body?
            Successful HTTP responses to ‘GET’ requests generally have a body which contains the requested information.
  
    in node js to create server we have `http` or `https` moduels.

    by using third party node modules also we can create server like `Express`
